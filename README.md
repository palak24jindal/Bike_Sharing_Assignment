# Prediction of Bike Sharing Demand

Problem Statement: This assignment is a programming assignment to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. 


# The steps we will follow for this assignment:
1. Reading and understanding the data.
2. Visualising the data
3. Preparing the data for modeling(train-test)
4. Training the model
5. Residual analysis
6. Predistion and evaluation on the test set
<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.  

- How well those variables describe the bike demands  

You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
The top 3 features contributing significantly towards explaining the demand of the shared bikes are:
1.	temp : 0.528658
2.	weather_light snow: -0.239440
3.	yr: 0.229879

The model with these features has 84.2% accuracy.
